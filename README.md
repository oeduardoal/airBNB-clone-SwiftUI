# 🏡 SwiftUI Airbnb Clone

This repository contains a SwiftUI app that clones the basic functionality and design of Airbnb. The goal is to learn and practice SwiftUI by replicating a popular application design.

## 🚀 Project Overview

As part of my SwiftUI learning journey, I am building an Airbnb clone app to explore the following key concepts:

- SwiftUI Views and Layouts
- Navigation between screens
- Building custom components

## 📱 Features

- User-friendly interface with smooth navigation
- Browse listings with images, titles, and prices
- View detailed information for each listing
- Search functionality to find specific properties

## 🛠️ How to Run

- Open the project in Xcode.
- Build and run the project on the iOS simulator or device.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

- Master SwiftUI layouts and modifiers.
- Implement navigation and state management in SwiftUI.
- Create reusable components and integrate them into views.
- Explore data handling with SwiftUI and integrate backend APIs later.

## 👨‍💻 Current Progress

- [x] Basic app structure with SwiftUI.
- [x] Property listing UI with mock data.
- [ ] Filter and search functionality.
- [ ] Backend integration for real data.
